# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for the Advent of Code challenge of 2025, in Ruby (3.3).

The solution to each problem is implemented as a class. Each class includes methods `part_one` and `part_two` that return the answer to parts one and two of each day's problem.

The solver classes are defined in files named after the days of the Advent of Code. To get the solution for part `<p>` of day `<dd>`, given some input in a file named `<file>`, run:

```sh
ruby d<dd>.rb <p> <file>
```
